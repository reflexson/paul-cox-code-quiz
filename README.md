## Description

This project is aan online quiz to test coding knowledge. It is a web application that uses html, CSS, and Javascript to guide the user through 10 multiple choice questions. Once the quiz is started, a 60 second timer begins and questions will fire with 4 selectable answer choices. The user will be told if they got the answer correct or wrong after selecting an answer. If the answer is wrong, 2 seconds will be taken off the clock. The quiz will go through the rest of the questions untill all 10 have been answered. The users score will be held in a variable and relayed to the user at the results page.  The option appears to enter initials and save that score to the "High Scores" section of the site.  If the user does this, the initials and high score are saved in local storage in an array which gets shown as an ordered list after it is sorted by best to worst score. The high scores are visible by selecting the high scores button at the beginning. This list is hidden if no objects are in the high scores array. 


This project helped me solidify Javascript concepts that we have covered in class.  Setting variables, generating functions, using objects, making arrays, adding event listeners, and commiting/retrieving data from local storage are a few of the concepts incorporated into this project. I also used media queries to ensure that the site looks as intended on a variety of devices. 
I used this project to test the limits of what I can accomplish with CSS.  I was ambitious with my styling to produce a product I am proud of. I learned a lot about how to properly organize a webpage so that other developers and users can easily view, navigate, add to, or edit this site. I also was able to learn and practice git procedures for pushing, pulling, branching, adding files, committing, creating pull requests, and merging branches through github.
